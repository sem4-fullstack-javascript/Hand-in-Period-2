# Period-2

## Why would you consider a Scripting Language as JavaScript as your Backend Platform?

## Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using, for example, Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat

## Node.js uses a Single Threaded Non-blocking strategy to handle asynchronous task. Explain strategies to implement a Node.js based server architecture that still could take advantage of a multi-core Server.

## Explain briefly how to deploy a Node/Express application including how to solve the following deployment problems:

### Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a (potential) exception that closed the application

### Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a server (Ubuntu) restart

### Ensure that you can take advantage of a multi-core system

### Ensure that you can run “many” node-applications on a single droplet on the same port (80)

## Explain the difference between “Developer outputs” and application logging. What’s wrong with console.log(..) statements in our backend-code, 

## Explain, using relevant examples, concepts related to testing a REST-API using Node/JavaScript + relevant packages 

## Explain, using relevant examples, the Express concept; middleware.

## Explain, using relevant examples, how to implement sessions, and the legal implications of doing this.

## Explain (conceptually) how you would handle sessions if you run your app in clusters to solve some of problems related to deployment.

## Compare the express strategy toward (server side) templating with the one you used with Java on second semester.

## Demonstrate a simple Server Side Rendering example using a technology of your own choice.

## Explain, using relevant examples, your strategy for implementing a REST-API with Node/Express and show how you can "test" all the four CRUD operations programmatically using for example the Request package.

## Explain, using relevant examples, about testing JavaScript code, relevant packages (Mocha etc.) and how to test asynchronous code.

## Explain, using relevant examples, different ways to mock out databases, HTTP-request etc.

## NoSQL, MongoDB and Mongoose

## Explain, generally, what is meant by a NoSQL database.

## Explain Pros & Cons in using a NoSQL database like MongoDB as your data store, compared to a traditional Relational SQL Database like MySQL.

## Explain reasons to add a layer like Mongoose, on top on of a schema-less database like MongoDB

## These two topics will be introduced in period-3

### Explain about indexes in MongoDB, how to create them, and demonstrate how you have used them.

### Explain, using your own code examples, how you have used some of MongoDB's "special" indexes like TTL and 2dsphere

## Demonstrate, using a REST-API you have designed, how to perform all CRUD operations on a MongoDB

## Explain the benefits of using Mongoose, and demonstrate, using your own code, an example involving all CRUD operations

## Explain the “6 Rules of Thumb: Your Guide Through the Rainbow” as to how and when you would use normalization vs. denormalization.

## Demonstrate, using your own code-samples, decisions you have made regarding → normalization vs denormalization 

## Explain, using a relevant example, a full JavaScript backend including relevant test cases to test the REST-API (not on the production database)
